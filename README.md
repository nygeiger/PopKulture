# Bio

This is an idea my father had for an app.

With my prior experience in web development I thought to build it out while also solidifying my web development skills.
In this stack theres the Front-end (vite, Typescript, React), and a simple Backend server (cors & express), a Database (Google sheets with api calls).

Try it out [Here](https://pop-kulture.netlify.app/). Hope you enjoy!
