# Pop Kulture

>Project Still In Progress !

A trivia app that tests your knowledge on decades worth of pop culture

Do you know more than those around you? Maybe even the world

## Game Modes

### Classic
Play solo or with teams and test your trivia knowledge. See how many points you can get!

### Challenge
So you really know your stuff? See how long you can go without getting any wrong. Or race against time and see how far you can rack up the score. See how you stack up against the world


# Bio

This is an idea my father had for an app.

With my prior experience in web development I thought to build it out while also solidifying my web development skills.
In this stack theres the Front-end (vite, Typescript, React), a simple Backend server (cors & express), a Database (Google sheets with api calls)

During this project I've learned a lot about cors and backend logic pertaining to http-request. I also reacclimated myself with React and its best practices.

Hope you enjoy!
